Did you ever played S.O.S or XOX ? 

It's almost same but more frustrating :)

Your goal is to make 619 to score.If you do 619 two times at the same round, 
you get to UpsideDown and in UpsideDown only way to score is make 616 or 919.

Be careful! Making 916 is not how you score, 6 always have to be left side of the 9. 

Remember this is a table game and your opponent is not phone, your best friend is.
